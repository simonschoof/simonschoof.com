## Moin Moin

I was born in Bremen and now live and work as a software developer in Hamburg.

My focus and interests in software development are in the areas of

- Object-oriented and functional programming
- Application Architecture
- Domain-driven design
- CI/CD and test automation
- Cloud computing and infrastructure as code 

From time to time I also write some frontend code, but as you can see on this page, not very often  :smile:

In my free time I like to be active, do yoga and go wakeboarding and surfing.  
I also like to hang out with friends, read books and keep up with popular movies and TV series.

For the future I want to improve my coding and interpersonal skills, do yoga and go surfing and wakeboarding as much as I can.   
But the main goal is to be a better person and reliable friend, a loving son and brother who cares about the world and environment.<cite>[^1]<cite>  
To do this in a sustainable way, I found this [post](https://tatianamac.com/posts/beware-of-burnout) very helpful.
