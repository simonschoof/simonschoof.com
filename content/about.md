## Moin Moin

and welcome! I am Simon and this is my website.

I was born in Bremen and am now living and working as a Software Developer in Hamburg.

My focus in software development is on

- Application Architecture
- CI/CD and Test Automation
-  Object Oriented and Fuctional Programming
-  Domain Driven Design
-  Cloud Computing & Infrastructure as Code  

From time to time I also write some frontend code, but as you can observe on this site not very often  :smile:

In my free time I like to be active, do yoga and go wakeboarding and surfing.  
I also like to hang out with friends, read books and keep up with popular movies and TV series.

For the future I want to improve my coding and interpersonal skills and go surfing and wakeboarding as much as I can.   
But the main goal is to be a better person and reliable friend, a loving son and brother who cares about the world and environment.   
To do so in an sustainable manner I found this [post](https://tatianamac.com/posts/beware-of-burnout) very helpful.
