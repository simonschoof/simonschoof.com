This post is the first part of a two article series on running a [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) instance on AWS with ECS and Fargate. To get familiar with Mastodon and its configuration, I decided to run Mastodon locally with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) first. This post will cover the steps to run Mastodon locally with docker-compose. The second part will cover the steps to run Mastodon on AWS with ECS and Fargate.
The code for this part can be found [here](https://github.com/simonschoof/mastodon-aws).

### Introduction

As I was never a huge fan of the existing social media platforms, I was looking for an alternative for a while. I stumbled upon Mastodon and got interested in it and the idea of [building protocolls instead of platforms](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech). As I was searching for Mastodon instances, the idea to host my own instance came up. I also thought it could be a good next project to write a blog post about. As I used AWS for my last project already, I thought it might be interesting to also run Mastodon on AWS. 

Before I start with the AWS part, I wanted to get familiar with Mastodon and its configuration. Therefore I decided to run Mastodon locally with docker-compose first. In the next sections I will cover the steps to run Mastodon locally with docker-compose. To get Mastodon to run with docker-compose, I am thankful that I found the following blog posts of Ben Tasker and Peter Babiƒç, which helped me a lot:
* https://www.bentasker.co.uk/posts/blog/general/running-mastodon-in-docker-compose.html#self_hosting
* https://peterbabic.dev/blog/running-mastodon-with-docker-compose/

In the next section I will describe the steps to adjust the docker-compose file to run Mastodon in a local setup for exploration and testing purposes.

### Adjusting to run locally

As I only want to run Mastodon locally for exploration and testing purposes, I will make some changes to the docker-compose file and the nginx configuration and deviate from the setup described in the blog posts of [Ben Tasker](https://www.bentasker.co.uk/posts/blog/general/running-mastodon-in-docker-compose.html#self_hosting) and [Peter Babiƒç](https://peterbabic.dev/blog/running-mastodon-with-docker-compose/). 

##### Get docker-compose file

First, I will get the docker-compose file from the [Mastodon repository](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/docker-compose.yml). There is no need to clone the whole repository, as the docker-compose file is the only file I need. Of cause you can also clone the repository and copy the docker-compose file from there.

##### Remove build statements

##### Remove networks

Remove the internal and external networks from the docker-compose file as there is no need to distinguish between internal and external networks when running locally.

##### Add Mailcatcher

```yaml
mailcatcher:
  restart: always
  image: schickling/mailcatcher
  container_name: mastodon-mailcatcher
  ports:
    - 1025:1025
    - 1080:1080
```

##### Add Minio

```yaml
minio:
  restart: always
  image: minio/minio
  ports:
    - "9000:9000"
    - "9001:9001"
  volumes:
    - minio_storage:/data
  environment:
    MINIO_ROOT_USER: minio
    MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: minio123
  command: server --console-address ":9001" /data
```
##### Adjust nginx configuration

I will create a self-signed certificate for the local domain: 

```bash
openssl req -x509 -out social.localhost.crt -keyout social.localhost.key \
  -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \
  -subj '/CN=social.localhost' -extensions EXT -config <( \
   printf "[dn]\nCN=social.localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:social.localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")
```

and add them to the nginx web server configuration:

```yaml
http:
  restart: always
  image: nginx:1-alpine
  container_name: mastodon-nginx
  ports:
      - 443:443
      - 80:80
  volumes:
      - ./nginx/tmp:/var/run/nginx
      - ./nginx/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d
      - ./nginx/certs:/etc/letsencrypt/
      - ./nginx/lebase:/lebase
```

Create a nginx configuration file for the local domain:

```conf
server {
        listen 80;
        listen   [::]:80; 

        root /lebase; 
        index index.html index.htm;

        server_name social.localhost; # Replace with your domain name

        location ~ /.well-known/acme-challenge {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

        location / {
                return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;                
        }
}

server {
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
        root /mnt/none;
        index index.html index.htm;

        server_name social.localhost; # Replace with your domain name


        ssl on;

        # Replace your domain in these paths
        ssl_certificate      /etc/letsencrypt/social.localhost.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key  /etc/letsencrypt/social.localhost.key;

        ssl_session_timeout  5m;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers On;
        ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;


        absolute_redirect off;
        server_name_in_redirect off;

        error_page 404 /404.html;
        error_page 410 /410.html;


        location / {
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;

            proxy_pass http://web:3000;
        }

        location ^~ /api/v1/streaming {
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;

            proxy_pass http://streaming:4000;

            proxy_buffering off;
            proxy_redirect off;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            tcp_nodelay on;
        }
}
```
