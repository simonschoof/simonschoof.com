I have wanted to dive into functional programming for a long time now. In my first job as a professional developer, I developed with C# and .NET, and I'm still a fan of C# and .NET. Especially after .NET officially set its sights on the Linux ecosystem in 2016. I also have a bias towards statically typed languages with type inference. With this in mind, it was natural for me to choose F# as the language for my first steps into functional programming.

To learn F# I rely heavily on the [awesome blog of Scott Wlashin](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com).
I especially try to follow his recommended [dos and dontÂ´s](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/learning-fsharp/#dos-and-donts)

Fsharp for fun and profitdos and donts. 

No emphasis on dependency handling or structuring a large scale project
